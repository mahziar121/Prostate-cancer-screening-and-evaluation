"A period life table is based on the mortality experience of a population during a relatively short period of time. Here we present the 2022 period life table for the Social Security area population, as used in the 2025 Trustees Report (TR). For this table, the period life expectancy at a given age is the average remaining number of years expected prior to death for a person at that exact age, born on January 1, using the mortality rates for 2022 over the course of his or her remaining life.",,,,,,

This life table is available for certain other years.,,,,,,
